# Brain-Tumor-MRI-Classification-using-CNN
This project aims to classify brain MRI images into four categories (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture is employed to improve classification accuracy and efficiency.
